Image 1 is the EXACT approved front-center character. Image 2 is a placement and
identity guide showing that same neutral head in all 24 slots. Edit those heads
into 24 successive rendered states of ONE identical rigid character. This is a
professional technical-animation asset sheet, not a collage of redesigned heads.

OUTPUT: 1536x1024 PNG, high quality. Exactly SIX columns and FOUR rows, 24 complete
separate heads in reading order. Keep the guide's exact centers and generous
proper margins. Each head is approximately 200 pixels wide and 158 pixels high,
with fixed camera scale. Solid pure BLACK background. Ensure all content is fully
visible. REMOVE ALL guide lines, captions, numbers and text in the final artwork.
No labels, letters, question marks, punctuation, icons, particles, confetti,
fireworks, stars, sparkles, hands, arms, body, pedestal, floor or cast shadows.

IDENTITY LOCK: preserve the reference's glossy blue/violet smooth helmet dome,
two thick cyan/cobalt rounded-square goggles perched ABOVE the faceplate, the
goggles' dark saturated-blue inset lenses, separate dark-blue faceplate below
them, pale blue/violet curved visor rim, and rounded blue/violet ear pods.
The goggles and shell are RIGID and IDENTICAL in every frame, with the same
proportions, silhouette, material, bevels, illumination and recessed lenses.
NEVER use the large goggle lenses as expressive eyes. The ONLY expressive eyes
are the TWO SMALL LUMINOUS CYAN MARKS in the LOWER FACEPLATE below the goggles.
Do not add a mouth, nose, eyebrows, hair, teeth or any facial feature.
Retain clean subtle glossy gradients without grain, stipple or texture changes.

EXPRESSION: {spec["description"]}

TEMPORAL PLAN: frame 00 is exactly the neutral reference. Progress steadily and
very gradually toward '{spec["endpoint"]}' at frame 23. The changes per adjacent
frame are tiny, with no jump at row boundaries. Row 1 covers expression strength
0-22%, row 2 26-48%, row 3 52-74%, row 4 78-100%. No animation restart in a new row.
Do not make all frames reach the final emotion immediately. No surprise extra
expressions between frames. Never rotate the head more than 6 degrees total.

Render each frame as a clean discrete view, NOT a blend or morph. No double
outlines, melting goggles, stretchy visor rims, squash/stretch, changes in ear
size, camera zoom, head shrinking or lighting changes. The head must remain
instantly recognizable as the exact approved mascot in image 1.

CRITICAL CORRECTION TO THE PREVIOUS ATTEMPT: do not make the first row already
curious. The first two heads MUST still have two equally open upright cyan eyes,
matching Image 1 exactly. Curiosity increases only gradually after those frames.
The FIRST ROW is almost neutral, NOT a line of already-half-closed right eyes.
Match the following approximate viewer-right eye heights in pixels in reading
order (one value per frame): {heights}.
The viewer-left eye stays 25 pixels tall until frame 8, then very gradually
increases to 27 pixels by frame 23. Both eye widths remain about 14-15 pixels.
Keep each eye's center in its normal faceplate location. Do not make the small
right eye a dot. Its final height is about HALF neutral, not nearly fully closed.
Rigid roll progresses evenly from zero to only 5 degrees counterclockwise.
Frame 00 and frame 01 should be visually almost identical to Image 1.
Again, the large goggles never change expression, size, lens shape, or design.
No text of any kind in the output. The guide's pixel values are instructions,
not labels to include in the generated image. Preserve generous black margins.
