//! A pet that returns to the middle of the screen every time it starts is a pet
//! you move every time it starts. So the position is written when it settles
//! and read back on the way up.
//!
//! The awkward part is not saving it but trusting it. A position is only
//! meaningful while the screen it was on still exists: unplug the monitor it
//! was living on, or come back from a dock, and the saved point is somewhere
//! nobody can see. So it is checked against the monitors that exist *now*, and
//! ignored when it no longer lands on one.
