//! Taking the mouse only when the pointer is actually on the character.

//! Tauri's `set_ignore_cursor_events` is all or nothing: there is no way to
//! pass clicks through while still seeing the pointer, the way Electron's
//! `forward` option does (tauri-apps/tauri#6164). So while click-through is on
//! the page receives nothing and cannot tell the cursor has arrived, and the
//! decision has to be made out here from the cursor's own position.
//!
//! That is not really a workaround. A companion on the desktop has to follow
//! the pointer across the whole screen, which a webview cannot see either, so
//! this same reading does both jobs.
