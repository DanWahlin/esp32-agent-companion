# Tagging and releases

This follows the Agent Arcade convention: stable `vX.Y.Z` tags trigger a build,
`git-cliff` groups commit messages into release notes, and GitHub Actions publishes
the downloadable files. Branch/PR builds and manual workflow runs validate and
upload workflow artifacts without publishing a release.

## Publish a version

Maintainers need Git, Python 3.10+, and [git-cliff](https://git-cliff.org/docs/installation/).
On macOS, `brew install git-cliff` installs the changelog tool.

Commit and push the intended changes to `main` first. Then, from the repository root:

```bash
python3 tools/release.py 0.1.0 --dry-run
python3 tools/release.py 0.1.0
```

Use the next unused stable version. The helper checks that the worktree is clean,
local `main` matches `origin/main`, and the tag is unused. It updates only `VERSION`
and `CHANGELOG.md`, commits them, creates an annotated tag, then atomically pushes
the branch and tag. It never stages unrelated files or force-pushes.

**The second command publishes a tag and starts the release workflow.** If the
final push fails, the local commit/tag remain for inspection; there is no automatic
rollback. After resolving the remote problem, push that existing release rather
than rerunning the helper:

```bash
git push --atomic origin main v0.1.0
```

An optional `COPILOT_SESSION_ID` adds Copilot attribution/session trailers.

## Release contents

| Asset | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `<repo>-v<version>-firmware.zip` | Python installer, checksums, and all matching flash `.bin` files |
| `<repo>-v<version>-sd-card.zip` | Optional `copilot/sprite-firmware.bin` for a FAT32 card |
| `SHA256SUMS` | Checksums for the downloadable ZIP files |

The installer validates the included files and writes each at its declared
address. It does not use `erase-flash`, pad a merged image over NVS, or modify the
SD card. A different existing firmware may use a different partition layout, so
users should back up its data before installing.

The SD file is intentionally paired with its firmware: pose tables and expected
sprite SHA256 are compiled into the application. A mismatched card pack is
rejected in favor of the built-in flash copy.

## Build release bundles locally

After a successful firmware build:

```bash
python3 tools/package_release.py --version "$(cat VERSION)"
```

Files appear in `build/release/`. `--name` and `--repository` override branding;
GitHub Actions derives both from the repository, so its artifact names follow a
future repository rename. The card's `copilot/` directory is a firmware path,
not a repository name, and remains unchanged.

## Automation details

`.github/workflows/build.yml` runs native tests, re-exports and compares sprite
assets, installs the pinned Arduino CLI/core and Waveshare libraries, builds the
firmware, then packages only a verified matched bundle. This needs no Azure
credentials or image-generation calls: all approved source artwork is checked in.

Actions are pinned to revisions. Build jobs have read-only repository permissions;
only the tag-triggered publishing job receives `contents: write`. The tag must
match `VERSION`. A manual run produces downloadable workflow artifacts, not a
GitHub Release. Neither workflow can verify physical touch response, card I/O
timing, or AMOLED scanout; those checks still require the device.
