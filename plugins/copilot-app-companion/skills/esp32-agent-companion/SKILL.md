# ESP32 Agent Companion

Use the MCP tools from the `esp32-agent-companion` server. Tool names may be
prefixed by the host; select the available tools whose names end in `status`,
`test_connection`, and `set_state`.

## Activity protocol

When this skill is active:

1. Call `set_state` with `working` before substantive tool use.
2. Refresh `working` after a long-running operation or before more work if the
   session may have exceeded the daemon lease.
3. Call `set_state` with `attention` immediately before an explicit user-input,
   approval, or decision gate.
4. Call `set_state` with `complete` only after the requested work is complete and
   verified.
5. Call `set_state` with `idle` when work is cancelled, abandoned, or ends
   without completion.
6. Use `surprise` only for an explicit user request or a genuinely exceptional,
   positive result; it is transient and does not replace the persistent lease.

Do not retry state calls repeatedly. If a tool reports that the daemon or device
is unavailable, report the error once and continue the user's primary task
without opening the serial port or running arbitrary recovery commands.

Use `status` for inspection. Use `test_connection` only when the user asks to
test the device or when diagnosing a reported connection problem.
